# YAdminCore
Plugin with, in my opinion, essential commands for the server. Made for **1.20.2**, but should also work on higher versions.
Plugin requires at least [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper), won't work on Spigot nor Bukkit.

# Commands
- heal and feed
- item
- memory
- god
- gamemode
- fly
- tp - In vanilla style
- tphere
- tpoffline
- back - Teleports back, based on the last teleport event
- entityinfo / playerinfo
- workbench, enderchest, anvil, grindstone, stonecutter, smithingtable, cartographytable, loom

### Other features
- SQLite or MySQL database for saving player data
- Fully customizable messages with lang file, supporting [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI) and [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/index.html)
- Commands with tab completions
- API for developers
