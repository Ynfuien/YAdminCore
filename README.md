# YAdminCore
Plugin with, in my opinion, essential commands for server admins. Using permissions for different command functionalities you should be able to precisely specify what admins can do what.

# Commands
- heal and feed
- item
- memory
- god
- gamemode
- fly
- tp - In vanilla style, with @ selectors
- tphere
- tpoffline
- back - Teleports back, based on the last teleport event
- entityinfo / playerinfo
- enchant
- workbench, enderchest, anvil, grindstone, stonecutter, smithingtable, cartographytable, loom

### Other features
- SQLite or MySQL database for saving player data
- Fully customizable messages with lang file, supporting [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI) and [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/index.html)
- Commands with tab completions
- API for developers

# Integrity with other plugins
I make these plugins for me, according to my needs, meaning, I don't search for every possible plugin that I don't care about, that could be somehow better integrated with mine. But, if you care about better integration between this plugin and some other, then just let me know through [Discord](https://discord.gg/kZJhKZ48j8) or GitHub and I will see what I can do.

Same goes for any features that you think may be missing. If something isn't outside the scope of the plugin, then I'll probably do it.
